# Uncertainty-Aware-Architecture
This folder contains research related to Uncertainty-Aware Self-Adaptive CPS. It has a systematic review over EU projects that target smart and collective behavior in CPS.

Systematic Review
----------------------------------------------------------
Cyber-physical systems (CPS) need to be designed to deal with various forms of uncertainty associated with data contributing to the system's knowledge of the environment.
Dealing with uncertainty requires adopting an appropriate model which then allows making the right decisions and carrying out the right actions (possibly affecting the environment) based on imperfect information.
However, choosing and incorporating a suitable model into CPS design is difficult, especially for non-experts, because it requires identifying the kind of uncertainty at hand as well as knowledge of suitable models and their application to dealing with the uncertainty.
While inspiration can be found in other CPS designs, the details of dealing with uncertainty in another CPS can be confounded by domain-specific terminology, context, and requirements.
To make this aspect of CPS design less daunting for non-experts, we aim at providing an overview of approaches dealing with uncertainty in the design of CPS targeting collective behavior.
To this end, we present a systematic review of relevant scientific projects with industrial leadership and a synthesis of relations between system features, the kinds of uncertainty, and models and methods used to deal with it.
The results provide an overview of uncertainty across different domains and challenges and reason about a guide for designing uncertainty-aware self-adaptive components in CPS.
